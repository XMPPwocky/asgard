"Stalker" - instrumentation/debugger. For native code, is a [[Dynamic binary instrumentation]] tool, apparently fast now

JS for scripting/tools... is there something that isn't [[Javascript]]? How does that even work? Presumably it's running on the "host" but I don't actually know much about what's going on under the hood

Useful for removing TLS / bypassing cert pinning on [[Android (operating system)]] apps, iOS too allegedly but I haven't used it
