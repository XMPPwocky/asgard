Joining two metals with a third, dissimilar metal (the solder) (thus distinguished from [[Welding]])

# Solder
## Leaded
## Lead-free

# Soldering iron
## Induction
Metcal introduced these... Temperature regulation is based on [[Curie point]], you send RF to a heating element and only the cold parts absorb power. Drawback is you can't change the temperature without changing the tip out...

# Hot air
Extremely useful (or even basically mandatory) for some [[Surface-mount technology]] parts.
