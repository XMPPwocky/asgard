A chirp is a signal whose frequency ramps up or down over time.

Quite useful in [[RADAR]], among other things.

Methods for capturing the [[Impulse response]] of systems (e.g. rooms or spaces in [[Audio processing|audio]]) will often actually play a chirp instead of an actual impulse. This spreads things out over time, and with a simple transform you can wind up with the original IR (with much less noise and artifacting).
