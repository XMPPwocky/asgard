Some not-necessarily-awful examples-

- Corporate managed devices

But also bad ones-

- [[Digital rights management]]
- [[Tivoization]]
- [[Stalkerware]]
- [[Nation-state malware]]

[[Memory corruption]], etc- especially in [[Boot ROM|boot ROMs]] - are excellent for letting users become owners... for better or for worse. "memcpy did more for software freedom than RMS ever could". Worried that improved [[Memory safety]] could make it harder and harder to gain control.

[[Fault injection]] may provide a way out of this, though... but requires hardware modifications.
