Fmin (?), 165BPM throughout but with some [[Half-time]] feel. This teardown describes timings exclusively in 165


B part seems to use [[Borrowed chord|some chords from Fmaj?]], though check, it might just modulate

## Arrangement
- after a lil intro (just for the album, simple), opens with just sub bass 
- somewhat unconventional - largely just two parts, no real repeats. each part is built around one basic theme. joined by veery simple 8-bar break (effectively just a rest)

### A part
built around 4-bar sub-bass pattern (with 2-bar phrasing, or 1 bar in half-time)for a lot of the beginning part here, there's no real harmony established!

initially, halftime feel, and even though later some drums at 165 do come in, the fundamental groove feels half-time, though decreasingly so throughout the A part.

[[Drum fill]]s mostly every 16? later as drums get more complicated it's harder to say

### B part (48 bars)

main components are [[Distorted kick drum|distorted kick]] (playing a dotted rhythm, tuned to chord root note?) and the TOUCH TOUCH sample pitchshifted with lots of [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]] that shift and build. Feels much more 165 than the A part. Some fairly intense breaks enter later- but they're in the [[Foreground-background (music)|background]] 

# Sound design
## A part
### "snare cycle"
Repeating 4-bar pattern of 4 distinct snares.

### Other percussion
drums feel organic, "wooden" (cambium!), a bit like You Can Recover. 

### Vocal synth 1
Shows up fairly briefly
### [[Formant filter|Formanted]] synth 2
 
## Rest
cute use of Windows notification sound, maybe a lil tacky but neat

## B part

### Kick drum
Kick is at least 2 [[Layering (music)|layers]] - one that seems [[Stereo width|wide in stereo]], distorted, pitchy; and another in the center of the stereo field?
