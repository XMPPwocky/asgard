When writing code (for some vague definition of "code!"), we're ultimately creating an [[Abstract syntax tree]]... but generally you work with a text representation of it in a general-purpose [[Text editor]]!

Intuitively, feels adjacent to [[Parse, don't validate]]?

[[Visual programming]] is arguably an instance of this?
