So, a normal [[Diesel engine]] works by compressing a fuel-air mixture, so [[Adiabatic heating]] raises it to its [[Self-ignition point]], right?

Well... if you had a gas that was [[Fissile material|fissile]]... you could "ignite" it by compression into a subcritical configuration in exactly the same way! (Or make the piston head and cylinder walls out of something fissile, and use an inert gas as the working fluid...)

This is surely impractical for loads of reasons, but it *is* fun to think about.
