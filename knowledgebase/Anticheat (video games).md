Software meant to detect or block [[Video game cheat|video game cheats]].

Similar to [[Antivirus]], but at a fundamental disadvantage - it runs *second*, and the user is (presumably) helping the cheat!
Maybe it has one advantage, though: catching cheaters only sometimes is relatively OK- assuming the cost of a game account is non-negligible. An antivirus that catches 50% of malware is a bit crap, an anticheat that bans cheaters 50% of the time is also a bit crap but still useful...?
