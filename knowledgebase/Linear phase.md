A system is linear-phase if it imparts a phase shift to components of a signal that's [[Linearity|linear]] w.r.t. [[Frequency]]. Equivalently, it imparts a constant, frequency-independent time delay to a signal. [[Finite impulse response|FIR]] filters are often, but not always. linear phase.

One inevitable result of a filter being linear-phase is that it'll have some [[Pre-ringing]]
