A chain of [[Software exploit]]s

The "classic" modern exploit chain is something like
- Exploit [[Information leak]] to bypass [[Address space layout randomization|ASLR]] and possibly [[Stack cookie]]s
- Some sort of [[Memory corruption]] issue to gain control of control flow, then [[Return-oriented programming|ROP]] or [[Jump-oriented programming|JOP]] chain to load/run [[Shellcode]]
- Possibly more exploits for [[Sandbox escape]] and/or [[Privilege escalation]]
