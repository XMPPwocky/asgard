Surprisingly, the traditional algorithm for multiplication by hand is an example of this- applied to digits!

Convolution in the [[Time domain]] is multiplication in the [[Frequency domain]] - and vice versa. Using the [[Fourier transform]], this lets you do large convolutions far more efficiently than a naive algorithm.

In [[Audio processing]], very useful for [[Reverb]] - since an impulse response can capture all the details of any [[Linear time-invariant system]], at least in theory.
