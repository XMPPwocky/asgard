An oscilloscope is fundamentally a [[Time domain]] device, though most can display a [[Fourier transform]] to approximate a [[Spectrum analyzer]] (albeit with much lower bandwidth)

Some oscilloscopes, known as "[[Mixed-signal]] oscilloscopes", combine an oscilloscope with a [[Logic analyzer]] into one device.
