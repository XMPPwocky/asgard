Build a [[Graph (computer science)|graph]] where nodes are "capabilities" and edges are ways to pivot ("given A, B, C, you can get D"), either intentionally or unintentionally. Simple in theory...

Attack trees are a special case of these...

The set of nodes reachable when "unintentional" edges are allowed but unreachable when they are not is thus the "impact" of all vulnerabilities.
