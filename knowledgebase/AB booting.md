Having two (or more?) "slots" for [[Firmware]]. You boot off one, updates are applied to the other. At reboot, you then boot off that updated slot. If boot fails, you can just switch back to the original, untouched slot.

Handy for [[Over-the-air update|OTA updates]] especially, where recovering from a [[Brick]] can be quite tricky
