An implementation of [[Verified boot]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 

Serves as a strong counter-example to claims of a [[Security-control tradeoff]]. Seems to clearly be designed to preserve both control/freedom and security.

# States
There are (at least) three states-

## Locked/"normal"
This is the default state. Firmware must be signed with OEM keys. No warning is displayed at boot.
## Red / "unlocked"
## Orange / "custom OS"
