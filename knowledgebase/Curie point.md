A material's Curie point is a temperature where it stops being (ferro?)[[Magnetism|magnetic]].

Used in RF [[Soldering#Soldering iron|Soldering irons]] for temperature regulation - because it can heat *different parts* of the heating element at different rates, it can be very good at giving fast temperature response.
