Adding more lanes to a road doesn't necessarily reduce traffic, because more people may use the road if there was less traffic.

But (sorta like with [[Risk compensation|risk compensation]]) this assumes your goal is to reduce traffic and not allow more people to go places. So it's a bit subtle...

That said, for traffic, you probably want to reduce driving in general - if you want to increase mobility, do that in other ways (transit, bikes, etc.) So the concept makes sense!
