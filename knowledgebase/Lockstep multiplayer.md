A [[Multiplayer game]] [[Game networking|networking]] concept - just have every player run the entire simulation each tick. Assuming the code is [[Nondeterminism|deterministic]] (a big assumption, [[Zettel/202202082307 Floats are effectively nondeterministic|especially if there's floats involved]], this works beautifully. Problems are 1. [[Latency]] and 2. state desynchronization. Often used in [[Turn-based game]]s.
