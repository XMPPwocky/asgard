A problem noted for [[Machine learning]]- because e.g. an image classifier is differentiable, you can [[Gradient descent|gradient-descend]] your way through it to find an image that's extremely close (to a human, perceptually) to an image of class A but the classifier considers class B with high confidence

Notably, this sort of image will [[Murphy v.s. Satan|almost never arise naturally]].
