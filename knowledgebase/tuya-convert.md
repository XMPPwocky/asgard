tuya-convert is a script that converts a Tuya device (one of a number of generic rebadged [[Internet of Things]] devices) to a custom firmware - by exploiting a [[Memory corruption]] issue over the air!

Thus it restores [[Owners v.s. users|ownership]] to the purchaser and user of a device - and patches a security hole while it's at it.
