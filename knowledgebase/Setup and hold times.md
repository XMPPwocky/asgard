For a [[Flip-flop (electronics)]], it's generally required that the data be stable for some time *before* the [[Clock signal]] edge (setup time), and for some time *after* (hold time).

Violations of this lead to [[Metastability (electronics)]].

A flip-flop's ==setup time== is ==the duration its data input must be held constant before each clock edge==.
