A bricked device is something rendered non-functional (typically via a software problem, often a failed [[Software update]])
# Types
## Hard-brick
A hard-bricked device is just entirely dead and unfixable.
## Firm-brick
My own term... something that requires e.g. connecting to [[JTAG]] or reflashing, often including physical disassembly or even [[Soldering]]
## Soft-brick
A soft-bricked device can be recovered without unusual hardware modification (e.g. entering into a recovery/EDL mode)
