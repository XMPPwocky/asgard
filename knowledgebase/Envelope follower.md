Given a [[Quadrature signal|quadrature signal]], just take the magnitude and low-pass that.

For real-valued signals, classic approach is to [[Rectification|rectify]] and then low-pass ... though I don't know if that's the best approach! 

I know there's a difference between [[Root mean square]] and peak... RMS seems intuitively "more correct" but...

Combined with a [[Voltage-controlled amplifier|VCA]] in hardware, or just a multiplication in software, used to implement [[Automatic gain control]] and [[Compression (audio effect)]]
