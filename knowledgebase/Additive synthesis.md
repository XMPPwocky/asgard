Fundamentally a [[Frequency domain]] approach to [[Sound design]]

Sum up a large number of "partials" (sines... at least usually sines, though I guess any [[Orthogonal basis]] might work... or really any function if you're trying to be creative)... modulating their frequencies and amplitudes to do the actual synthesis.

Often used for [[Resynthesis]], because it can generally closely approximate any sound (and then that can be tweaked)
