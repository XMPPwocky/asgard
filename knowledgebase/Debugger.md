A tool for single-stepping, tracing, setting [[Breakpoint]]s, etc... in software.

Some debuggers are more focused on security research / [[Exploit development]], e.g. PEDA is a plugin for [[GDB (debugger)]]; Immunity has their own debugger which was (or still is?) a fork of OllyDbg...

[[Binary Ninja]] has a debugger plugin but my historical experiences with it have been... lacking.
