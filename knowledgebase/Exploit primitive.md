Generally when you gain some sorta abstract "ability", e.g. "write 4 arbitrary bytes to an arbitrary address" or "offset past the end of this buffer".

You can ideally abstract over that, even when the actual exploitation process is quite complicated... and just write a function that takes an address and a value and writes that value.

Pretty much every modern exploit / [[Exploit chain]] I've ever seen does this
