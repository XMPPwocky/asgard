analogy with [[Graph coloring]] applied to the corners of a ([[Hypercube|hyper]])cube

# Examples
The trivial error-correcting code is 2-of-3 redundancy- send each bit 3 times, take the majority "vote". Each block of 3 bits can correct 1 bit error... but 3x overhead, and can't detect 2-bit errors. (3-of-4 redundancy can detect 2-bit errors, but at the cost of a whopping 4x overhead!)

[[Checksum]]s and [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRCs]] can detect errors but not correct them.

[[Hamming code]] - often gives SECDED (can you do better?)

[[Reed-Solomon code]]

[[Turbo code]]

[[Convolutional code]] - AIUI this contains many of the others (all?)
