Compare to [[Symbolic execution]], almost as a sort of really coarse-grained version where instead of a full expression for e.g. a [[Register (CPU)|CPU register]]'s contents, you simply determine whether or not it depends on some input.

Can be either an overapproximation or an underapproximation...

[[Perl (language)]] had some sort of "taint" idea which was built into the language itself? Seemed interesting, but doesn't seem to have caught on.
