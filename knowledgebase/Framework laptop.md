A [[Laptop]] designed for [[Repairability]].

[[Embedded controller]] firmware is now open-source!

# Complaints
- 13" is a bit small, still, to be honest
- Hinge is loose - falls open too easily
	- awesome customer support replaced my hinge, we'll see!
		- Ah, yeah, new hinge is better.
- Battery life could be a bit better, though some of this is [[202201241500 Linux power management disaster]] 
	- Wish the battery was removable (externally)
- Seems to run rather hot?
- Only Intel CPUs :(
