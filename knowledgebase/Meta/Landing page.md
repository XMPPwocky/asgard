# What
These are some notes on things I have taken.

The audience for these is mostly me. Any usefulness to you is secondary. Sorry.

Many notes are unfinished. "Finished" ones are rare enough that I haven't come up with a great tag for them yet. Sorry.

Some (many...) notes are just stubs, too- mostly useful for their links and backlinks. I'm trying to tag these with #stub, at least, so I can go back and fill them in maybe. (Will I do that? History says no.)

# Who
I'm Mimir! Find me on Twitter as [@XMPPwocky](https://twitter.com/XMPPwocky)...

I do [[Embedded device]] security stuff. I also attempt to [[Making music|make music]], emphasis on attempt. I also dabble in *lots* of things- there's quite a [[Long tail|long tail]] of random concepts (mostly from science/engineering/math, but not all!) that I just happened to be thinking about, usually on a wiki-walk or similar.

# Why
Maybe somebody else'll want to see these someday.

Also useful to point people at things like [[Embedded security toolkit|my guide to building a small hardware hacking toolkit (WIP)]], and info about [[Learning reverse engineering]]... less effort than a real "blog", and following links is fun!

I have 32GB of RAM in my [[Framework laptop]] for two reasons:
1. Because [[202202021411 Binary Ninja uses lots of RAM|Binary Ninja]], my preferred [[Reverse engineering]]/[[Static analysis]] tool, loves RAM.
2. Because I love having obscene amounts of tabs open.

#2 there should give you an idea of just how "organized" these notes are. Speaking of which...
# Organization and layout
The primary way I use these notes is by following links/backlinks, and secondarily by using search.

There are some folders. They're mostly not *that* useful for discovering things, besides the technology/domain-specific ones (e.g. "Rust" and "Linux kernel internals"). More just to keep clutter out of the root [[Namespace|namespace]]. Regardless, here they are-
