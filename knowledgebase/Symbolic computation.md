Related to [[Symbolic execution]], naturally - symbolic execution implies doing it on programs not originally written symbolically. (Arguably, symbolic execution means *writing an [[Emulator]] symbolically* (and then state forking))

Can be implemented in most languages using [[Operator overloading]].

Some languages/environments have more first-class support - AIUI [[MATLAB]] does, for example.
