Given a [[Resonance|resonant]] system and [[Feedback]] with sufficient gain, you can make an oscillator.

Notably, positive v.s. negative feedback doesn't mean as much as it intuitively might here- negative feedback can oscillate too (the difference is conceptually just an extra 180 degree phase shift).
# Examples
- [[Laser|Lasers]]
- [[Wien bridge]]
- "Feedback" on e.g. a PA system - you're exciting [[Modes of vibration]] of the room!
	- For this reason you can detect [[202201212216 Slow decay near criticality]] in almost-feedback-y systems
