# What is the VTU-3?
Redesign of the LoJack "Police tracking computer" - in other words, roughly, the "receiver" end of the LoJack system, tracking stolen vehicles.

Antennas: 4 antennas in a square pattern, roof-mounted on police car.

The system is able to display an arrow pointing to the detected vehicle - presumably doing [[Radio direction finding]]
