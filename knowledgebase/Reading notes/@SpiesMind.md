Discusses [[Yomi levels]] in the context of [[eSports]], particularly [[Fighting game]]s.

Starts out with example of simple [[Counterplay]]... goes into a whole big long example

[[Randomization]]/[[Nondeterminism]] as a strategy too...

Attempts to explain [[Beginner's luck]] in this context. Also naturally seems to apply to [[Cheese strategy|cheese strategies]], at least in some instances.
