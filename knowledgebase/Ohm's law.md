Describes the [[I-V curve]] of an ideal [[Resistor]].

Extended to complex [[Impedance]], can also describe the magnitude (and [[Phase]]) response of linear [[Alternating current|AC]] systems at a certain frequency.

# Flashcards
The current through an ideal resistor is::Voltage divided by resistance
<!--SR:!2022-03-10,32,270-->

The resistance of an ideal resistor is::Voltage divided by current
<!--SR:!2022-05-15,77,270-->

The voltage across an ideal resistor is::Current times resistance
<!--SR:!2022-05-13,76,270-->

Ohm's law (for unknown current $I$) is ==$I=V/R$==
