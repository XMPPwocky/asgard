Representing a real-valued signal as a rotating [[Complex number|complex number]].

Intuition: Because, for the same reason [[Quadrature encoders]] are required to differentiate forwards from backwards movement, quadrature signals can differentiate positive from negative frequencies!

Hm... is this related to the same Nyquist-domain-inversion stuff that makes [[Polyphase channelizer]]s work?
