The cost to an attacker of doing some attack. Fuzzy term- generally means in dollars and/or "resources", especially time and effort.

Thinking in this way requires you assume an attacker to be somewhat rational, which is a risky assumption! (Though you could still *slow* an attack, that's often not too helpful.)
