Take a signal, square each value, average those squares (producing a "mean square"), take the square root of that.

Effects:
- First, the squaring operation naturally [[Rectification|rectifies]] the signal.
- Second, outliers (large values) have a much larger effect - when used as e.g. an error term this is useful
- Also there's something about power, in electronics... e.g. [[Ohmic heating]]
