Code and data paths split.

v.s. [[von Neumann architecture]]s.

in some sense less "beautiful", in that it sort of obscures the sorta fundamental [[202202072109 Data-code equivalence|equivalence between code and data]] in real systems. But critically helps reduce pressure on the [[Memory bus]]...

# Modified Harvard architecture
In a modified Harvard architecture, [[Caching|cache]]s are split between a data and an instruction cache, but the main [[Memory bus]] is still ultimately unified (as in a [[von Neumann architecture]])

as in [[x86 (Architecture)]]/[[x86-64 (Architecture)]], [[ARM (architecture)|ARM]] (in general)
