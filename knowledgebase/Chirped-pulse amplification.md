Problem: Want to amplify a short [[Laser|laser]] pulse. But gain medium damages itself beyond a certain power level...

Solution: _Spread out_ the pulse in the [[Time domain]], amplify it, and then re-compress it. Stretched pulse has significantly lower peak power (but longer duration), so can be amplified more; re-compression then gives short, high-power pulse.

Do the spreading/unspreading using a [[Diffraction grating]].
