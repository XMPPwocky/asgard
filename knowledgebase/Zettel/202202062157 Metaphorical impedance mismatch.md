Sort of a forced metaphor, but- [[Impedance]] mismatch as.. really just meaning "mismatch" or "discontinuity", in general.

Originally encountered referring to an "[[Object-relational mapping]] impedance mismatch" - as an argument that ORMs are inherently flawed or at least a *very* [[Leaky abstraction]].
