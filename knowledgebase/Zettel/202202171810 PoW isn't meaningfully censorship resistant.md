Claims [[Proof-of-work]] or similar is needed for [[Censorship|censorship resistance]] (for [[Cryptocurrency]] stuff) are wrong: it's neither necessary nor sufficient.

Why not sufficient: because censorship resistance *for financial transactions* is not useful in general without [[Privacy|privacy]] guarantees, especially [[Zero knowledge|ZK]] ones. The [[Chilling effects]] from users who know their transactions are public (and permanently so!) can be as bad as actual blocking of transactions would be. So you need privacy tech.

Why not necessary: Given that you need a proper ZK system to be truly censorship-resistant, a [[Centralization|centralized]] coordinator, etc. already should have no ability to censor - it shouldn't be able to tell which transactions are allowed and which are not!
