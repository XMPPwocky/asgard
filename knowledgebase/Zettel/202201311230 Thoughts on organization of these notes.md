# Folders
## Root folder
  Things outside a folder. These almost work like a personal [[Wiki]]- in the sense of [[Wikipedia]]- at least as far as I'm using them. Largely descriptive "articles".
## Guides
  Almost "blog-post-y" articles.
  ### Motivation
  Have a place to collect longer or more "finished" writing. Also maybe help navigation if anybody else ever reads this.
## Domain-specific
  e.g. "Linux kernel internals", "Rust", "Song teardowns".

  For "Rust" and "Linux kernel internals", focus is mainly on actual specific types, functions, etc. and (secondarily) the *implementation details* of key concepts (e.g. [[Capabilities]]) 
  ### Motivation
  Allow pages like [[struct task_struct]] to make sense without needing an even longer suffix to disambiguate.
  ### Fictional folders (Worlds)
  #### Motivation
  Don't want to get fictional stuff confused with regular notes.
## Reading notes
  From [[Zotero (reference manager)]].
  ### Motivation
  When I read something useful or interesting, I'll roughly summarize it (often *very* roughly) in there.
  One note per citekey.

## Zettel
  This one is fun.
  ### Motivation
  Useful for ideas, concepts, thoughts... that don't have an obvious unambiguous or [[Canonicalization|canonical]] name. Many of these could go in sections/subheadings inside other articles, but then it's harder to see connections in the [[Graph (computer science)|graph]] view.

  Also smaller concepts that may not really warrant their own note in the root namespace. Observations. Single facts I want to remember.

## Miscellaneous flashcards
  A bit of a hack. These just have to go *somewhere*. Might move them into Zettel eventually.
  ### Motivation
  For large tables, lists, etc. that might not fit too well elsewhere.

# Flashcard organization
Using the [[Spaced repetition]] plugin - flashcards have to live somewhere.

Most of my flashcards, at least for now, live on the page that mentions them (especially root namespace pages). One drawback is it causes a fair few spurious Obsidian Publish updates (reviewing a flashcard updates an [[HTML]] comment)
