Pretty much everything related to [[Nix]] lacks good documentation.

Lack of both docs and [[Zettel/202201212220 Types are documentation|an expressive type system]] cause lots of problems (for me) in [[Nix]]- the language itself is at least somewhat well documented, but things like [[Nixpkgs|nixpkgs]] and [[NixOps]] aren't.
