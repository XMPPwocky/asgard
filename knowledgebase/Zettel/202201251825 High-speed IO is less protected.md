At lower speeds, [[IO buffer]]s etc on a chip will generally have at least some reasonable level of protection from momentary overcurrent ([[Short circuit]]s to ground, etc.), [[Electrostatic discharge]], etc.

But as speeds rise, those protections are often sacrificed for performance (e.g. higher drive strength requires lower output [[Impedance]]).

Because of this, fast IO is particularly vulnerable to damage.
