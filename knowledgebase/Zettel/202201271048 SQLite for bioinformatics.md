[[SQLite (database engine)]] is surprisingly useful for handling [[Bioinformatics]] data - directly!

Because it can import [[Tab-separated value (file format)]], with surprisingly little preprocessing it can pull in a [[Variant Call File (bioinformatics)|VCF]]

and then do nice efficient queries after building an index.
