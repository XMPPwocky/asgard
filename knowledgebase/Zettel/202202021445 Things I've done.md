## Security
### [[Steam (service)|Steam]] / [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] stuff
- Broke Steam's [[Cryptography|cryptography]] (a pretty straightforwards [[Padding oracle]])- https://steamdb.info/blog/breaking-steam-client-cryptography/
- Various [[Remote code execution|RCE]] bugs in the [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], particularly [[Team Fortress 2]].
- More... #finishme

### [[Bluetooth Classic]]
- Found a [[Specification bug]]/[[Footgun]] in the [[Bluetooth Classic]] spec.
