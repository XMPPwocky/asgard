# Abstract design
Encrypting [[Email]] is generally fail

[[Web of trust]] as implemented in PGP seems to fail hard.

# Specification

Loads of [[Attacker wiggle room]], both cryptographically and because of nested "packet" format.

Keyservers have dumb DoS issues.

# GnuPG
Code quality is very dubious.

No real API(!) - rather, you're supposed to parse the command line `gpg` binary's stdout!
