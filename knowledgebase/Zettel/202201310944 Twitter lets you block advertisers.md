[[Twitter (social networking site)|Twitter]] lets you just... block [[Advertising|advertisers]].

If you do this enough, you get to the [[Long tail]] of ads- and they get pretty weird.

Sometimes you'll get specialized/"industrial" ads...

other times just random people promoting tweets for... no apparent reason.
