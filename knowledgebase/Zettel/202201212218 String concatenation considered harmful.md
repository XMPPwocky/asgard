In general, concatenating strings is easy and simple, but sort of subtly wrong.

When producing any sort of structured data, you "should" be manipulating that data structure directly. See also the hypothetical [[AST editor]]

Even when producing text for human consumption, you really want some sort of [[Localization]] / translation system rather than just sticking characters together!
