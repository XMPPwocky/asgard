Tools shape what you do with them!

For example, in [[Digital audio workstation|DAWs]] - music I write in [[Bitwig (DAW)]] is noticeably different from what I make in [[Renoise (DAW)]]. The tracker interface makes working with fixed-length patterns much more natural, whereas Bitwig's clip-based workflow makes different lengths easier. Small [[Articulation (music)|articulations]] are really easy to add in Renoise with effects commands, while in Bitwig they just feel a bit clunkier and more "hidden".

[[Programming language]]s have a similar thing.

So do [[Reverse engineering]] tools, though it's trickier there because it's not really a "creative" process in the same sense - still, what tools you use do shape your approach.
