You'd think that for e.g. a [[Write-what-where]] an attacker would prefer to be able to directly specify an address to write to, instead of an offset from e.g. some [[Heap (memory allocation)|heap allocation]]. But this is often not true. In a world with [[Address space layout randomization|ASLR]], an absolute address can be almost useless - what you want is typically to corrupt some [[Metadata|metadata]] for the [[Heap (memory allocation)|heap]] or some stuff on the [[Call stack|stack]]. And having a *relative* offset is ideal for that!

Of course, if you've defeated [[Address space layout randomization]] via an [[Information leak]], this doesn't apply as much...
