Basically... [[Bluetooth Classic#^1f088c|it hops]], it hops fairly fast (~625us) with not much dead time, the whitening sequence depends on the [[Piconet clock (Bluetooth)|piconet clock]] value (!!!) which isn't sent explicitly... even the address of devices isn't sent! You can figure that out, but... oof.

The whitening is one of the most obnoxious things here...
