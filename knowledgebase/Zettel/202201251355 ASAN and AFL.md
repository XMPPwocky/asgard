[[AddressSanitizer|ASAN]] is quite useful for [[Fuzzing]] to spot subtle [[Memory corruption]] issues that don't immediately crash (especially running in persistent mode, where worst-case it may crash *later*)...

But ASAN consumes huge amounts of virtual memory, and AFL's default memory limit logic counts that as actual memory use!

The "easy" approach is to just disable the memory limit when fuzzing with ASAN... but [[cgroups (Linux)]] can also be used...

Does ASAN uses a huge amount of physical memory?::Not really, the big issue is *virtual* memory

[[AFL (fuzzer)|AFL]] will not work on ASAN enabled binaries unless you ==disable the memory limit==.
