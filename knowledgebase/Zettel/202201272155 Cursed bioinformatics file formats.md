[[Bioinformatics]] has some pretty entertaining file formats- mostly things that are [[Textual file format]]s and as a result surprisingly processable using general-purpose tools. But also it makes them very funny.

E.g. [[Variant Call File (bioinformatics)]] is basically just a [[Tab-separated value (file format)]] with a header...

But also other things, e.g. FASTA/FASTQ which are basically just literal lists of (textual) base-pair reads with extra metadata...

Also, [[bgzip (gzip variant)]].
