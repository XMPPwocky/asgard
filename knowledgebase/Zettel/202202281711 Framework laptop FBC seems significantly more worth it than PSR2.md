On the [[Framework laptop]], enabling [[Panel self-refresh|PSR2]] (v.s. just PSR1) disables [[Framebuffer compression]]. While PSR2 should be able to save more power than PSR1, the cost (in memory bandwidth and power) seems too high.

Idle power usage seems better with PSR2, but for any nontrivial actual use (e.g. web browsing) FBC seems to win.
