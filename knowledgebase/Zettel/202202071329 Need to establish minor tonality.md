In my experience, it's really easy to "slip" from a [[Minor key|minor key]] to the [[Relative key|relative major]]. Need to try to explicitly establish the mode when [[Making music|writing music]] in minor. 

Also makes [[Modal mixture (music)]] much stronger when the [[Tonality|tonality]] was unambiguously minor before(!).
