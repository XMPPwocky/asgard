Originally heard about this in the context of the [[borrowck]], which ends up basically enforcing this.

Some claims that "when you really want [[Pure function|purity]] (in the [[Functional programming]] sense), you maybe really just want aliasing ^ mutability". Not as... well, pure, though...

The fact that Rust references never [[Aliasing (memory)|alias]] is supposed to be able to help a lot with [[Compiler optimization]]s, same reason "restrict" exists in [[C (programming language)|C]].
