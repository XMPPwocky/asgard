Took me a while to figure out when I first learned [[Calculus]], but [[Derivative (Calculus)|differentiation]] and [[Integral (Calculus)|integration]] are sort of [[Higher-order function]]s - i.e. "derivative(expression)" is sort of a function from functions to functions.

Not precise, but a key insight that solved a lot of my confusion.

Maybe more precisely would be considering them as functions from [[Symbolic computation|symbolic expressions]] to symbolic expressions - sort of "[[Rewrite rule]]s". This is especially true for differentiation, since that's almost exactly what [[Automatic differentiation]] actually is.
