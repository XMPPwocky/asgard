"[[Entropy]] gathering"

Systems often use [[Interrupt (computing)]] timing to gather additional entropy; ultimately this comes from [[Clock skew (electronics)]] for "automated" interrupts, plus just the entropy of the external world for things like keystroke timings.

Also LSBs of [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] inputs (i.e. noise) for the same reason
