Originally thought of re: models of [[Electromagnetism]] -

- [[Maxwell's equations]] capture underlying physics well, but hard to reason about for nontrivial systems. ([[Field solver]]s can be very useful for this reason, though!)

- [[Lumped element model]] ...

- The [[Transmission line|transmission line]] model is very useful for certain cases, too - captures [[Wave]]effects like [[Reflection (transmission lines)] nicely

But all abstractions are [[Leaky abstraction]]s in some cases!
