Noticed that in a lot of [[Puzzle game]]s, e.g. [[Outer Wilds]], [[Baba Is You]], [[Return of the Obra Dinn]]... the feeling of being "stuck"- that no forward progress is possible, that things just don't make sense... tends to mean that I'm assuming something that isn't correct.

 Then realized this also applies in real situations (esp. [[Reverse engineering]])- when something seems "baffling" or "impossible", well... maybe it is, *with the assumptions I've made*!

 In some sense this is a sort of [[Modus tollens]] or [[Proof by contradiction]]- if I can prove "if my assumptions are correct, this result/desired outcome is impossible" and know/can prove "this result/desired outcome is possible", then my assumptions are incorrect (or my logic has just broken... though that likely leads to the same place, an incorrect *intermediate* assumption)
