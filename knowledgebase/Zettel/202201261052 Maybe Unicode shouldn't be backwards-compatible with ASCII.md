[[Unicode (character set)|Unicode]] and especially [[UTF-8 (Character encoding)|UTF-8]] are [[Backwards-compatiblity|backwards-compatibile]] with [[ASCII (character set)|ASCII]]. This is maybe convenient in some ways (and saves a lot of often-unnecessary reencoding)... but it also means that if some software mishandles Unicode or just treats UTF-8 strings as ASCII, it's easy to not notice if you don't test on non-ASCII inputs.
