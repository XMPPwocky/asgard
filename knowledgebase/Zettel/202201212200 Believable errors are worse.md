[[Machine learning]] has this issue a lot- especially things like image inpainting, where you can "hallucinate" detail instead of just being e.g. blurry

Arguably also a [[Murphy v.s. Satan]] issue - if random errors are detectable, but an attacker can craft an error that *doesn't look like an error*...

Some interesting connections to [[Error-correcting code|error-correcting and detecting codes]]- the whole thing there is to make some symbols "invalid". When an error is undetected, it has gone from a "valid" to another "valid" symbol...
