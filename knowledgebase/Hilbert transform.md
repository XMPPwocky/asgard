In [[Digital signal processing]], the Hilbert transform *[[Phase shift|phase-shifts]] every component of a signal 90 degrees*.

It's done by [[Convolution]] with $\frac{1}{\pi t}$ , so it's naturally amenable to a [[Finite impulse response]] filter implementation (well, approximation, but error falls off fast)

# Uses
Handy to convert a real-valued signal to a [[Quadrature signal]] (at the same frequency).
