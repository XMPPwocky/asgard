Typically works by getting a deterministic trace of execution...

Really handy for [[Vulnerability research]] and [[Exploit development]]...

rr is the main tool I'm familiar with for doing this under Linux; WinDbg (preview?) on Windows works quite nicely too, I've heard, though I haven't had much of a chance to try it...
