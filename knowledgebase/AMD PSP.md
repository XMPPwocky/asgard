"Platform security processor".. A lot like the [[Intel CSME]] in terms of function... though AIUI it's in the CPU itself (on the IO die?) instead of the chipset. Which makes a bit more sense-  the [[DMI (bus)]] link on Intel platforms is a weakness.

[[ARM (architecture)]] based.

Some vague hints a similar thing may be present on AMD GPUs?? (Maybe for [[High definition content protection]]?)
